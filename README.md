# Personal Website

Written in NodeJS with Express, SASS, and Pug. Also incorporates a RaspberryPi for IoT goodness.

## Website Concept

The concept behind this site was to emulate a Linux desktop and terminal. It's a simple site at the moment and has yet to reach it's full glory. However, I did manage to get everything working on a very basic level - mainly getting my Express server to communicate with a RaspberryPi in my office that can switch a lamp on and off. The Pi has a Python webserver running on it that has an API endpoint that controls some GPIO of the Pi.
